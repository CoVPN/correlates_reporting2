`r paste(concatList(rep('#',level+1)))` Tertiles cumulative incidence plots 

The vaccine arm incidence curves are estimated by marginalizing over a Cox model. The placebo arm incidence curve is estimated based on a null Cox model. The placebo curve may not go all the way to tfinal.tpeak because the last point shown is the last event time in the placebo arm.


The data ribbon is estimated based on survfit separately within each tertile using ph2 data only, without any covariates. Thus, blanks occur when a strata is depleted after a time point.
