`r paste(concatList(rep('#',level+1)))` Tertiles cumulative incidence plots 

The incidence curves are estimated based on a Cox model. The data ribbon is estimated based on survfit separately within each tertile using ph2 data only, without any covariates (thus possible to have blanks when a strata is depleted after a time point).
