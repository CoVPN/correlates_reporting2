<!-- `r paste(concatList(rep('#',level+2)))` Tertiles cumulative incidence plots -->

The tertiled incidence curves are estimated by marginalizing over a Cox model. The comparison arm incidence curve is estimated based on a null Cox model. The comparison arm curve may not go all the way to tfinal.tpeak because the last point shown is the last event time in the comparison arm.


The data ribbon is estimated based on survfit separately within each tertile using ph2 data only, without any covariates. Thus, blanks occur when a strata is depleted after a time point.
